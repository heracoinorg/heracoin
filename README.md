# What is HERA BLCOKCHAIN?

##  Introduction 

Bitcoin is gold, Light Coin is silver, and Heracoin is bronze. Heracoin is a digital asset built on Bitcoin that uses almost the same algorithm as Bitcoin in terms of technology. Heracoin is actually a derivative of Bitcoin. However, Heracoin's goal is to make up for Bitcoin's shortcomings and become a better digital asset. For example, Heracoin not only ran SegWit, but is also developing a lighting network based on it.​

## Coin Features  
Hera Coin is similar to Bitcoin, but there are three major differences.  

1. Unlike Bitcoin, where Segbit is still in progress, Heracoin successfully executed it in 2018. Segwit is a technology that improves the signature part of the protocol, resulting in the same effect as expanding to 4MB without increasing the block size.Heracoin has already been resolved even before the scaling issue, which can only be structurally raised when the volume of transactions increases.Also, SegWit's fast execution is receiving positive reviews in that it can promote the development of new technologies.​ ​   

2. The coin generation cycle has been reduced to a quarter of Bitcoin, speeding up transactions, and currency issuance is four times that of Bitcoin.
  
3. The cryptographic hash function is different from Bitcoin.Bitcoin uses SHA-256 hashing algorithm, which can be applied to mining equipment called ASIC, which has increased difficulty and increased entry barriers for mining.To prevent this concentration of mining power, Heracoin uses an algorithm called ASIC-Resistant Script (Script).It can be easily mined by the general public.

## Core Value(Keyword: Transaction Speed)  
Heracoin generation cycle from 10 minutes to 2.5 minutes.
The transaction takes place about four times faster than Bitcoin by reducing it to five minutes. Furthermore, we are developing a lighting network that can be run based on SegWit, which, if completed and introduced, can speed up transactions by 1 million times faster than the current speed.​

Heracoin is opensource project. And hera is a Blockchain using the highly-secure and power-efficient NIST5 algorithm. Combining limited Proof-of-Work, hera coin (hera) is unique in its distribution.

## Our Mission
Leverage Blockchain technology and provide users with fast and secure transactions.
We believe Blockchain is the future for many purposes such as data storage, payments and operations. Integration of Blockchain for our daily use leads to higher efficiency in applications.

### Fast, Today
Time is one of the key elements in our lives. Especially when it comes to financial transactions, lack of existing money transaction speed, companies or individual users are facing delays. This leads to a slowdown in activities. HERA offers a solution to cover such bad processes. Time is money, money is HERA.

### Safe & Anonymous
Security is another very important point on which today's world stands. By using HERA you can make secure payments be done, which gives confidence to the community.

### Decentralized, Distributed
Applications are the future need for higher efficiency and cost reduction. HERA is your solution for decentralized Payments.

### Efficiency
HERA uses the NIST5 hash, which is chosen as the winning algorithm by the US Nation of Science competition. Combination of security and mining efficiency were the key points taken into account.

# Why NIST5?
Hera chose to use NIST5 as its hashing algorithm because it has been proven to be more secure and power-efficient than other leading algorithms. NIST5 is a combination of the finalists and winner of the US National Institute of Standards and Technology Hash Function Competition (specifically BLAKE, Grøstl, JH, Keccak/SHA-3, and Skein). NIST5 was created fairly recently, and immediately saw use by other coins, but failed to see mainstream adoption.
